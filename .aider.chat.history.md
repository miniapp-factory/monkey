#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### large, fat-bodied ape  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files that are not yet in the chat:

1. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this file to describe the logo image you want to generate.  
2. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – edit this file to update the `title` and `description` constants.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A large, fat-bodied ape sits in the center of a lush jungle scene. The ape has a round, plump body, thick limbs, and a friendly expression. Its fur is a deep brown color with subtle shading to convey volume. The background is a vibrant green forest with dappled sunlight filtering through a canopy of leaves, creating a warm, natural atmosphere. The image should be eye-catching and convey a sense of playful strength.
